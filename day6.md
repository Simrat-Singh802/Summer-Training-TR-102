 Topic: Encapsulation, Name Mangling, Exception Handling
 Date: 2nd July 2025
 Encapsulation

Today, I learned about Encapsulation, which is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming.
It means wrapping data and the methods that work on that data into a single unit—usually a class. It is used to hide the internal state of an object and protect it from outside access.

Encapsulation allows only specific parts of a program to interact with the object's data, which prevents accidental changes and maintains security. It also helps in keeping the code clean, organized, and easier to
manage.

 Name Mangling

Name Mangling is a concept in Python that is closely related to encapsulation.
When I create a private variable in a class by using double underscores before its name, Python automatically changes its name internally to make it harder to access from outside the class.

This process is called name mangling. It is not a strict form of security, but it discourages the misuse of internal variables by making them less obvious or accessible.

Exception Handling

I also studied Exception Handling, which is used to manage errors in a program.
Sometimes, a program may face unexpected situations like dividing by zero or receiving the wrong type of input. Instead of crashing, Python allows us to catch and handle these errors gracefully.

Exception handling makes a program more robust and user-friendly. It includes special blocks that check for errors, respond to them, and ensure that important parts of the program still run even if something goes
wrong.

My Learnings Today

Encapsulation hides internal details and protects data.

Name Mangling helps prevent direct access to private class members.

Exception Handling helps avoid crashes and keeps the program stable during errors.
