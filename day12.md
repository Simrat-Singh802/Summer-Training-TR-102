Topic Covered: Basics of Seaborn (Data Visualization in Python)

What I Did Today:
Today, I started learning the basics of Seaborn, a high-level data visualization library in Python that works well with Pandas DataFrames and is built on top of Matplotlib. I explored various features of Seaborn
and how it simplifies the process of making attractive and informative statistical graphics.

Here’s what I practiced:

Imported Seaborn using import seaborn as sns and also used matplotlib.pyplot for showing the plots.

Loaded data using pandas.read_csv() and worked with columns to extract relevant data for visualization.

Created my first line plot using sns.lineplot() to show trends over time.

Understood the importance of the x and y axis while passing data.

Noticed how Seaborn automatically handles plot styling, colors, and legends, making the plots cleaner.

Also used sns.barplot() and sns.scatterplot() briefly to see how other chart types work.

Learned about the integration between Seaborn and Pandas DataFrames.

Tools/Libraries Used:

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Observations:

Seaborn makes it easier to generate cleaner plots with less code compared to Matplotlib.

It’s great for handling data directly from DataFrames and provides built-in themes and color palettes.

Sometimes understanding the required format for input data (like long vs. wide format) is important for accurate plotting.

Plan for Tomorrow:
Tomorrow, I will focus on solving practical questions and exercises based on Seaborn. This will include:

Creating different types of plots (histogram, box plot, swarm plot, etc.)

Working with real datasets (like Titanic or weather data)

Customizing plots (titles, axis labels, styles)

Exploring Seaborn’s advanced features such as categorical plots and statistical visualizations.
