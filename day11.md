Topic: Completed Matplotlib

Today, I finished learning Matplotlib, an essential Python library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. It was a very productive 
session where I explored various tools and techniques to represent data visually. Here's what I covered in detail:

Learned how to import and use matplotlib.pyplot effectively.

Created line graphs to observe trends over time.

Plotted bar charts to compare categorical data and understood how to control bar width, color, and orientation.

Created histograms to show frequency distributions.

Designed pie charts and added labels, percentages, and legends to make them more readable.

Practiced plotting multiple graphs in one figure using subplot() and subplots().

Customized the look and feel of plots — changing colors, styles, fonts, and adding gridlines.

Used the Titanic dataset to apply all these concepts in real data — visualizing survival rates, passenger classes, and other statistics.

Working with Matplotlib improved my understanding of data interpretation and visual storytelling. I also faced some syntax issues and logical errors while plotting, 
but debugging helped strengthen my grasp on the concepts.

Overall, this session has built a solid base for more advanced data visualization libraries like Seaborn and Plotly. I now feel confident in using Matplotlib to 
support future data science or machine learning projects.
