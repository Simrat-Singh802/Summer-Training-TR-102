Introduction to Deep Learning

Basics of Neural Networks

What I Did Today:
Today, I stepped into the world of Deep Learning, a branch of machine learning that focuses on algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain — called Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). I focused on understanding the foundational concepts of deep learning and how neural networks work.

Part 1: Introduction to Deep Learning
What I Learned:
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks to learn from large amounts of data.

It is especially powerful in tasks involving images, text, and speech, and works well with big data.

Unlike traditional ML, deep learning models can automatically extract features from raw data.

Applications of Deep Learning:
Image recognition

Natural language processing (NLP)

Autonomous driving

Language translation

Fraud detection

Part 2: Understanding Neural Networks
Key Concepts:
A neural network is made up of:

Input layer – Takes in the features of the data

Hidden layers – Perform weighted transformations and activations

Output layer – Produces the final prediction

Each layer consists of neurons (nodes) connected to the next layer through weights.

The activation function (like ReLU, sigmoid) introduces non-linearity into the model.

Important Terms I Studied:
Weights and biases – Parameters learned during training

Forward propagation – Data flows from input to output

Loss function – Measures prediction error

Backpropagation – Adjusts weights using gradient descent to minimize loss

Observations:
Neural networks are more complex than traditional ML algorithms but more powerful for unstructured data.

Visualizing a simple 3-layer network helped me understand how inputs are transformed layer by layer.

The choice of activation function and number of layers/neurons has a big impact on model performance.

Tools & Libraries Used:
Numpy – To understand mathematical operations behind neural networks

Basic diagrams and resources – To visualize network structure
