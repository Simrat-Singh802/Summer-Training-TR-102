🧠 Topic: String Programs in Python & PyCharm IDE Setup

✅ What I Practiced Today

🔤 String Programs:

Today, I focused on understanding and practicing various string-related problems in Python. The key tasks I completed were:

Reversed a string to understand indexing and slicing.

Checked whether a string is a palindrome.

Counted the number of vowels in a given string.

Removed duplicate characters from a string to get unique characters.

Found the frequency of each character in a string.


These exercises helped me get comfortable with string manipulation, loops, and conditionals.

🛠 PyCharm IDE Setup

I also set up PyCharm IDE today for writing and organizing my Python code. Here’s what I did:

Installed PyCharm Community Edition.

Configured it with Python 3.10 as the interpreter.

Created a new project called PythonPractice.

Wrote and tested all string programs inside this project.

Customized the appearance and enabled helpful plugins like Git support and docstring generators.
Working in PyCharm felt more efficient and made it easier to write, test, and manage code.

🔍 Reflections

Practicing string problems gave me a better understanding of Python's core concepts.

Using PyCharm helped me improve my productivity and code organization.

I'm starting to enjoy solving problems and exploring how strings work behind the scenes.
