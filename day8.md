Daily Diary – Day 8

Date: 4th July 2025

Topic: NumPy (Completed)

Today, I successfully completed learning and practicing the NumPy library in Python. I focused on writing and understanding code involving various NumPy operations.

What I Did Today:

Practiced creating arrays (1D, 2D, and using different methods like arange(), linspace())

Implemented code using loops and .append() with NumPy arrays

Worked on identity matrices, array indexing, slicing, reshaping

Extracted specific elements like last columns, diagonals, and sub-arrays

Learned array operations such as:

Element-wise addition, subtraction

Broadcasting

Logical filtering and conditions


Completed examples for random values, though without using random module

Explored conversion between Python lists and NumPy arrays


Status:

NumPy successfully completed with hands-on coding. I now feel confident to move to the next topic.
