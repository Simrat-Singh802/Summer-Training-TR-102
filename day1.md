 Topics Covered:

Integers, floats, strings, and booleans


Input and Output

input(), print(), and formatted strings


Conditional Statements

if, elif, else


Loops

for and while loops


Functions

Global Variables

Understanding the difference between local and global variables

Using the global keyword



 Key Takeaways:
