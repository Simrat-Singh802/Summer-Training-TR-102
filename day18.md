Topic Covered: Linear Regression on a New Dataset & Model Improvement

What I Did Today:
Today, I applied linear regression to a new dataset to test my understanding and improve my existing model-building skills. This was a great way to reinforce what I’ve learned and identify areas where I could
make the model more accurate and reliable.

Key Activities:
1. Working with a New Dataset:
Loaded and explored a new dataset, analyzing the structure, column types, and data quality.

Identified the target variable to be predicted and selected suitable input features.

Handled missing values and made sure the data was clean before applying the model.

2. Building the Model:
Applied linear regression to the cleaned dataset.

Split the data into training and testing sets to ensure fair evaluation.

Trained the model and made predictions to assess its initial performance.

3. Model Improvement:
Reviewed the model’s accuracy and performance metrics (like R², MAE, RMSE).

Noticed areas where predictions were off and worked on improving them.

Made the following improvements:

Feature selection: Chose more relevant or fewer features that better explain the target variable.

Data scaling: Considered using min-max or standard scaling where needed.

Outlier handling: Detected and removed outliers that were negatively affecting the model.

Visualization: Used plots to better understand patterns and relationships in the data, helping refine the model.

Observations:
Changing datasets gave me a deeper understanding of how flexible and sensitive linear regression is to the quality of data.

Small changes in feature selection and data preparation can significantly affect the model’s accuracy.

Visualizing results helped me identify areas of improvement quickly.
