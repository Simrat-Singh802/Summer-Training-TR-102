Topics Covered: Confusion Matrix & Grid Search for Hyperparameter Tuning

What I Did Today:
Today, I focused on two important topics in the model evaluation and optimization phase of machine learning: the Confusion Matrix and Grid Search. Both are essential when working with classification problems and tuning models for better accuracy and performance.

Part 1: Confusion Matrix
What I Learned:
A Confusion Matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model.

It breaks down predictions into four categories:

True Positive (TP) – Correctly predicted positive class

True Negative (TN) – Correctly predicted negative class

False Positive (FP) – Incorrectly predicted positive class

False Negative (FN) – Incorrectly predicted negative class

What I Practiced:
Created a confusion matrix using predictions from a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression or Decision Tree)

Analyzed the matrix to find:

Accuracy – Overall correctness

Precision – Correct positive predictions out of all positive predictions

Recall – Correct positive predictions out of all actual positives

F1 Score – Balance between precision and recall

Observations:
Confusion matrices help in diagnosing specific types of errors, not just overall accuracy.

Useful especially when the dataset is imbalanced, where accuracy can be misleading.

Part 2: Grid Search (Hyperparameter Tuning)
What I Learned:
Grid Search is a method to automatically find the best combination of hyperparameters for a model.

It evaluates the model for every combination of parameters you provide and selects the one with the best score.

Commonly used with cross-validation to avoid overfitting.

What I Practiced:
Used Grid Search to improve the performance of models like Decision Tree or Logistic Regression

Tuned parameters like max_depth, criterion, or C (for regularization)

Compared the model’s accuracy before and after tuning to see improvements

Observations:
Grid Search can be time-consuming but ensures optimal performance

It’s an essential step before finalizing a model for deployment or prediction

Tools & Libraries Used:
Pandas – Data preparation

Scikit-learn – For confusion matrix, model evaluation, and GridSearchCV

Seaborn / Matplotlib – For plotting confusion matrix heatmaps
