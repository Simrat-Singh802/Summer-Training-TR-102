Topic Covered: Types of Plots in Seaborn and Solving Practice Questions

What I Did Today:
Today, I continued working with Seaborn and focused on exploring the different types of plots it offers. After learning the basics yesterday, I practiced applying 
them by solving various questions using real datasets.

Here’s a summary of what I covered:

Types of Seaborn Plots I Studied:
Line Plot – sns.lineplot(): To visualize trends over a continuous variable (e.g., years vs temperature).

Bar Plot – sns.barplot(): For comparing categorical data.

Count Plot – sns.countplot(): To count the frequency of categories.

Box Plot – sns.boxplot(): For visualizing data distribution and spotting outliers.

Histogram – sns.histplot(): To display the distribution of a numerical variable.

Scatter Plot – sns.scatterplot(): To show relationships between two numerical features.

Swarm Plot – sns.swarmplot(): For showing all data points while avoiding overlaps.

Violin Plot – sns.violinplot(): Combines boxplot and KDE to show distribution.

Questions and Practice:
Solved multiple questions using custom datasets and the Titanic dataset.

Practiced filtering columns using Pandas and plotting based on selected features.

Customized plots using titles, labels, and Seaborn themes (sns.set_style()).

Compared multiple categories on the same chart using the hue parameter.

Tools/Libraries Used:
Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Observations:
Seaborn provides clear and aesthetically pleasing visualizations.

Understanding which plot type to use depending on the data is crucial.

Using the right DataFrame format helps prevent errors in plotting.
