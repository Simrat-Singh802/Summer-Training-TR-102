Daily Diary â€“ Learning Python (Control Flow & Functions)
Date: 30 June 2025
 Topics Covered: if, else, match, while, for, function

 If and Else
Today, I started with if and else statements. These are used for decision-making. I learned how to write conditions that the program checks, and based on whether they're true or false, it chooses a path.I also 
practiced using elif for multiple conditions. It felt good to control the logic of the program using these statements.

 Match Statement
Then I explored the match statement, which is like a cleaner alternative to multiple if-elif conditions. It's a newer feature in Python and feels more organized, especially when there are many cases to handle. It
reminded me of switch-case in other programming languages.

While Loop
Next, I studied while loops. I understood that they repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true. I practiced writing loops that count, ask for input, and break out of the loop when needed. It taught me 
how to manage repetition in a smart way.

For Loop
After that, I worked with for loops. These are great when I want to loop through a list, a string, or a range of numbers. I realized how useful for loops are when doing something a fixed number of times or when 
working with collections.

 Functions
Finally, I focused on functions. Writing my own functions felt like creating tools. I learned how to define a function using def, give it a name, pass parameters, and return results. It made my code more organized
and reusable.

Summary
Today I understood how programs make decisions, repeat actions, and use reusable blocks of code. I feel more confident writing Python programs now.
