Daily Diary â€“ Day 9

Date: 7th July 2025

Today, I successfully completed learning Pandas in Python. Pandas is one of the most powerful and widely-used libraries for data manipulation and analysis. I explored and practiced how to handle datasets efficiently
using DataFrames and Series, which are the core data structures in Pandas.

Here are the key topics I covered:

Understanding and creating Series and DataFrames

Reading and writing data from CSV, Excel, and JSON files

Performing basic operations like filtering, sorting, indexing, and slicing

Using functions like head(), tail(), info(), describe() for quick data insights

Handling missing data and performing data cleaning

Applying groupby, merge, concat, and pivot tables for data aggregation and restructuring

Plotting basic charts using Pandas' integration with Matplotlib

I also practiced real-world examples and small projects to solidify my understanding. Learning Pandas gave me a deeper insight into data analysis and prepared me for working with structured datasets.
