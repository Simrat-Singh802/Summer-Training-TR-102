Daily Diary - 1st July 2025
Dear Diary,
Day 5
Today was an insightful day in my Python learning journey! I explored some really interesting and powerful concepts. Let me pen them down for future reflection.

 Lambda Functions
I started my day learning about lambda functions – small anonymous functions that are defined using the lambda keyword. It was exciting to see how compact and efficient they are, especially when used with map(),
filter(), or sorted(). They helped me understand how functional programming blends into Python so well.

 Arrays
Next, I explored arrays. I understood that while Python doesn’t have built-in array types like other languages, we can use lists or import arrays from the array module for numeric operations. Arrays are useful 
when dealing with large datasets that require numerical computations, and they take less memory compared to lists. I also saw how indexing and slicing works just like in lists.

 Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)
In the second half of the day, I dived deep into OOPs concepts.

 Classes and Objects
I learned that a class is like a blueprint, and an object is an instance of that blueprint. Defining attributes and methods inside a class made a lot of sense once I practiced it. It gave me a structured way to 
model real-world entities. Creating multiple objects from the same class showed how powerful and reusable code can become.

 Inheritance
I then explored inheritance, where a class (child) can inherit properties and behaviors from another class (parent). This helped me reduce redundancy and write cleaner code. I practiced both single and multilevel
inheritance and noticed how super() can be used to access parent class constructors and methods.

 Polymorphism
Lastly, I studied polymorphism – the idea that functions or methods can behave differently based on the object calling them. Method overriding within inheritance and operator overloading really fascinated me. It 
showed how Python supports flexibility in design and makes programs more dynamic and scalable.

 Reflection:

It’s amazing to see how Python supports both functional and object-oriented programming styles. Today’s learning opened a new dimension in my programming mindset. With each concept I grasp, I feel more confident 
and ready to build real-world applications!
