Daily Diary – Day 19

Date: 21st July 2025

Topic Covered: Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)

What I Did Today:
Today marked an important step in my learning journey — I officially started studying Machine Learning. I explored what machine learning is, how it works, and how it is used in real-world applications. I also 
reviewed different types of machine learning and the general workflow of building a machine learning model.

Key Concepts I Learned:
1. What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is a method of teaching computers to learn patterns from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed.

It is a core part of data science and artificial intelligence.

2. Types of Machine Learning:
Supervised Learning – The model learns from labeled data (e.g., regression, classification).

Unsupervised Learning – The model finds patterns in data without labels (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).

Reinforcement Learning – The model learns by interacting with the environment and receiving feedback (rewards or penalties).

3. ML Workflow:
Data Collection

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Feature Selection/Engineering

Model Building

Model Evaluation

Prediction and Deployment

4. Real-World Examples of ML:
Email spam detection

Movie or product recommendations

Weather forecasting

Medical diagnosis

Stock market prediction

What I Practiced:
Reviewed datasets to understand how they are used in ML projects.

Understood the steps to train a model and test it using Python libraries like scikit-learn (without writing detailed code yet).

Reflected on how my recent work with linear regression fits into the broader scope of machine learning.

Observations:
Machine Learning is a broad and exciting field with many applications.

Understanding the data is just as important as building the model.

It’s important to choose the right algorithm and evaluation metrics based on the problem type.
