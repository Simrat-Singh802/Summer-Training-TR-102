Daily Diary – Day 10

Date: 8th July 2025

Today was a productive and engaging day in my data science journey. I focused on sharpening my skills in 
Pandas and began exploring the basics of Matplotlib, which is crucial for visualizing data effectively.

What I Did:
Practiced several Pandas problems using real-world-like datasets (e.g., Titanic dataset):

Loaded data from a CSV file and displayed it in full using .to_string()

Used conditional logic to clean and update specific values (e.g., setting minimum age values)

Iterated through DataFrame rows using .index and .loc

Became more comfortable with reading and modifying tabular data efficiently

Introduced myself to Matplotlib:

Understood the structure and syntax of matplotlib.pyplot

Learned how to create basic visualizations like:

Line plots for trend analysis

Bar charts for categorical comparisons

Histograms for data distribution

Also explored how to add titles, labels, and legends to make charts more informative

Key Learnings:
Pandas is incredibly powerful for both data wrangling and data cleaning.

Matplotlib offers a clear and customizable way to present data visually.

Proper visualization helps to communicate findings more effectively and spot patterns easily.

Reflections:
I’m starting to realize how important it is to combine coding with data storytelling.

Visualization brings life to raw data, and tools like Matplotlib make that process intuitive.

Looking forward to combining Pandas and Matplotlib for full-scale data analysis projects.
