Topic Covered: Solving Questions on Linear Regression

What I Did Today:
Today, I practiced linear regression by solving multiple questions using different datasets. The goal was to understand how to apply the concepts I learned earlier — such as training a model, making predictions, and evaluating its performance — in real scenarios.

Key Steps I Followed:
1. Understanding the Dataset:
I started by exploring the dataset, checking for missing values, and identifying which column should be predicted.

Selected appropriate input (independent) and output (dependent) variables based on the problem.

2. Building and Training the Model:
Trained a linear regression model using the chosen features.

Understood how the model calculates the line of best fit based on the relationship between the variables.

3. Making Predictions:
Used the trained model to make predictions on test data.

Compared predicted results with actual values to see how accurate the model was.

4. Model Evaluation:
Evaluated the model using different metrics like:

R-squared (R²) score, which shows how well the model explains the variability of the output

Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which show how far off the predictions are from the actual values on average

5. Visualization:
Plotted the data and the regression line to visually check how well the model fits.

Observed if the points were closely scattered around the line, which indicates a good fit.

Observations:
Applying linear regression to real datasets helped reinforce the theory I studied earlier.

It’s important to clean and understand the data before training the model.

Model performance depends on how well the input variables explain the target variable.
