Topic Covered: NumPy Basics (till Filtering)

Today, I focused on learning the fundamentals of NumPy, a powerful Python library for numerical and array-based operations. Here's a 
detailed summary of what I covered:

 Introduction to NumPy:
Learned that NumPy (Numerical Python) is used for high-performance mathematical operations on large arrays and matrices.

 Creating Arrays:

Used np.array() to convert lists into arrays.

Explored np.zeros(), np.ones() to create arrays filled with zeros and ones.

Practiced np.arange(start, stop, step) to generate sequences.

Used np.linspace(start, stop, num) to create evenly spaced values.

 Array Operations:

Performed element-wise operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division between arrays.

Learned about broadcasting – how NumPy automatically expands shapes for operations.

 Array Attributes:

Checked properties like .shape, .ndim, .size, and .dtype.

 Reshaping Arrays:

Used .reshape() to change the structure of arrays.

Learned about flattening arrays with .flatten().

 Indexing and Slicing:

Practiced selecting specific elements, rows, and columns.

Learned slicing techniques: array[start:stop] and advanced slicing using steps and negative indices.

 Boolean Indexing and Filtering:

Created conditions to filter arrays, e.g., arr > 5.

Used boolean arrays to extract specific values based on conditions.

Combined multiple conditions using & (and), | (or).

 Summary:
Today's learning gave me a strong foundation in NumPy array creation, manipulation, and filtering. These tools are essential 
for handling large datasets efficiently and will be especially helpful in future data analysis and machine learning projects.
